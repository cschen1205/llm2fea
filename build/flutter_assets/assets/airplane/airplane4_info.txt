Reflection Summary
- The prompts from the banana airplane list were chosen based on their fitness scores, drag values, and 3D volume values to ensure a balance between drag reduction and volume maximization.
- Crossover and mutation techniques were applied to create new prompts with the aim of predicting higher fitness scores for the synthesized banana airplane objects.
- The content and structure of the prompts were carefully considered to influence drag and volume characteristics accordingly.
- In generating the new prompts, sub-words related to aerodynamics and volumetric optimization were selected to potentially enhance the fitness score of the resulting banana airplane shapes.
